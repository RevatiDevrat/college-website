           <p class="post-text">Course Curriculum Overview : I chose civil engineering because i like it very much. In our branch only a few students will be and most of them are boy's because only we prefer this branch maximum. The course curriculum was fully related to JNTU kakinada and the syllabus will be updated for every 5 years. The college focuses more on practical learning also because our college mainly encourage the students to get clear learning. Many reasearches are going on in our campus and many faculty are included in those research works. There is a research center cell in our campus were many students are included to take part in the researches.
            Internships Opportunities : The college also encourages the students for internship programs but much offers will not be provided. The students involved in research works and those getting good score in semester will be given chances for these internship programs. The internships are provided by the companies like Volkswagen,mahindra,vizag steel plant etc.,. Some of the companies provide stipend and it will be around 5-10k. As we are still second year we didn't get any chance for internship but in third we will go.

           <h2 class="sub-heading">DETAILS</h2>
           <p class="post-text">Fee Structure And Facilities : As our college is one among the top college in andhra they collect a little large sum of fee. As i am a management student i paid around 1 lakh per annum and for the counselling students it is around 55000/- per annum. The hostel fees include around 35,000/- and extra amounts will be collected for bus and books. The fees is affordable for the counselling students but for management students it is little large amount compared to some other colleges. But the amount collected by the college satisfies the facilities provided.</p>
           <p class="post-text">Faculty : The faculties are professional persons upon deep knowledge of their domain.Most of them have succeeded their Ph.D and many of the staffs are still persuing it.They are sociable and guide us in our project works.The standard of educating is likewise excellent but i think that it might be enhanced and the management must handle it. The staffs in our institution are very interactive and we can come out with any doubts we've and the doubts would be clarified on spot by the staffs.
