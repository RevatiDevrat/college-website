In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 2.5 milliwatts, giving it a very short range of up to 10 metres (33 ft). It employs UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz.[3] It is mainly used as an alternative to wire connections, to exchange files between nearby portable devices and connect cell phones and music players with wireless headphones. </p>

            <span class="post-date">4 march 2023</span>
            <p class="post-description">Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. It involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries and has a wide range of applications, from virtual personal assistants to self-driving cars. Before leading to the meaning of artificial intelligence let understand what is the meaning of Intelligence- 

              Intelligence: The ability to learn and solve problems. This definition is taken from webster’s Dictionary. 
              
              The most common answer that one expects is “to make computers intelligent so that they can act intelligently!”</p>

            <span class="post-date">4 march 2023</span>
            <p class="post-description">Native app development is the creation of software programs that run on specific devices and platforms. You can build native apps for desktops, smart TVs, and so on — but since the most popular target devices are smartphones, native app development is frequently used to mean mobile app development.

              According to Statista’s latest data, Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS operating systems have squeezed every other mobile OS out of the market over the years, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, they made up 99.4 percent of the total mobile market. So we can safely say that going into 2023, mobile app development is still all about building native applications for the Android and iOS platforms.</p>
